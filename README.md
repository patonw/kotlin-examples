# Kotlin Examples
Miscellaneous examples ported to Kotlin as standalone Gradle projects.

## graphql-ktor
A mock GraphQL service running on Ktor.

Uses graphql-java for the underlying engine without Spring or any dependency injection.
Showcases how Kotlin's builder and extension syntax can be used to simplify wiring of resolvers.

## opencl-lwjgl
Porting the OpenCL example from LJWGL to Kotlin.

This demonstrates how you can take advantage of GPU acceleration for data parallel calculations.

I would recommend taking advantage of Kotlin's coroutine API to work with OpenCL asynchronously.
